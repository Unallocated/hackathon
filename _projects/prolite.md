This is a LED sign that sits in the area above the restrooms in the hackerspace that is highly visible. The sign is not currently operational.

Code has been written that can interface with the sign and can update it with multiple messages. The primary
goal at the hackathon will be to write a REST api to interface with the existing code so that the sign can be
operational and put into use. Secondary goals can be completed if time allows. Secondary goals are:

 * Adding features
 * Improving code quality
 * Deamonizing code to run as a service
 * Adding audible notification of sign update
